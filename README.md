# lemonade
This repository was created for our LIS2407 course to enrich our collection of resources surrounding Beyonce's Lemonade. 
In the repository, you'll find our unique schema and XML metadata files for 14 items in our collection. On the wiki page, you'll find our report on creating and implementing our own schema for our collection. 

Feel free to create your own metadata using our schema! As Beyonce herself said, "Come on ladies, let's get information." (Or something like that...)
